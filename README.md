# MarioBrosDieAndRetry

This was my **first coding project.** 
the goal of the project was to create a **90's game in C language with a given library.**  
the tree of the file is not perfect because at the time I did not marry photos in a folder, sources in another...

## How to build 

 - Download the directory.
 - Open a terminal in.
 - `make`
 - `./exemple`
 - And enjoy playing

## Goal of the project

We chose to r**emastered Mario Bros to a DieAndRetry style**. You have to complete the different levels with as little death as possible by avoiding traps ;). there is a death counter on the top right.  
**Controls:** 

 - keyboard arrows to move
 - spacebar to jump

  
Here are some ScreenShot of the game.
